## Introduction

This repository is structured to guide you through essential machine learning concepts and techniques using various python ML libraries. Each topic is covered with hands-on examples in Jupyter notebooks.

## Learning Topics

### NumPy

NumPy is the foundation of numerical computing in Python. Below are the key learning topics covered in this repository:
- [Arrays](data_analysis/numpy/numpy-arr.ipynb)
- [Indexing](data_analysis/numpy/numpy-indexing.ipynb)
- [Operations](data_analysis/numpy/numpy-operations.ipynb)

### Pandas

pandas is a versatile library for data manipulation and analysis. This repository covers the following topics:

- [Series](data_analysis/pandas/series.ipynb)
- [Dataframes](data_analysis/pandas/dataframes.ipynb)
- [Group elements](data_analysis/pandas/groupby.ipynb)
- [Combining dataframes](data_analysis/pandas/merging_joining_concatenating.ipynb)
- [I/O](data_analysis/pandas/io.ipynb)
- [Operations](data_analysis/pandas/operations.ipynb)
- [Handling missing data](data_analysis/pandas/missing_data.ipynb)
- [Data Visualization](data_visualization/pandas/Pandas.ipynb)

### Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is the foundation upon which many other visualization libraries are built, including Seaborn.
- [Basics and various data plots](data_visualization/matplotlib/Matplotlib.ipynb)

### Seaborn
Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for creating visually attractive and informative statistical graphics. It simplifies the process of creating complex visualizations by offering a set of default themes and color palettes that make plots more appealing.
- [Categorical plots](data_visualization/seaboarn/categorical_plots.ipynb)
- [Distribution plots](data_visualization/seaboarn/distribution_plots.ipynb)
- [Grids](data_visualization/seaboarn/grids.ipynb)
- [Style and color](data_visualization/seaboarn/style_color.ipynb)


### Scikit-learn
scikit-learn is a powerful and widely used machine learning library in Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data analysis and modeling. It is built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, making it highly compatible with other scientific computing libraries in the Python ecosystem. scikit-learn is designed to be accessible to both beginners and experts, offering a wide range of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and more.
